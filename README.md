## Introduction

In this project, I focused on data exploration and calculation of several metrics in the e-commerce sector. The input data is a publicly available dataset on Google BigQuery. Here are a few characteristics of this dataset:

- Data is stored in tables, each table stores data for one day of the year.
- The entire dataset is a system of tables for each day from January 8, 2016 to August 1, 2017.
- The tables all have the same format as follows:
